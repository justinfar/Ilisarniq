# Using Ilisarniq

Ilisarniq is a typeface family designed by Ã‰tienne Aubert Bonn which you can download over [here](https://coppersandbrasses.com/retail-fonts/ilisarniq).

To be able to host the font on my Gatsby site, I used a plugin called `gatsby-plugin-your-fonts` following the instructions over [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-your-fonts/).

If you want to use the font you can clone this repo and host it using GH pages or some other CDN or use [my link](https://justinfar.github.io/Ilisarniq) when defining the host in your `gatsby-config.js`
